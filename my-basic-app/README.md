# Project created with Create React App and Redux of POKEMON API

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Folders order

Features folder contain the logic of each feature (slicer as reducer, api as async actions, and logic inherent to the feature), separated from the view (components) to keep a clean, tidy and easily accessible code. The store is on the app folder as the template generated.

Basics contain shared view components as cards, buttons, etc.

Config contain the router and the logic using lazy loading and suspense to improve the performance of the app as single page


## Used elements

 1.Prettier, eslint and husky to establish a clean code.
 2.Redux toolkit, with slices.
 3.Modular CSS usage
 4.MEMO and useMemo for card rendering performance

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, to see the app running, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
